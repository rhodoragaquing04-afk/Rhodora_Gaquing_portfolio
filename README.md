 About Me
Hi I'm Rhodora Gaquing and I am 19 years old from Santa Cruz, Occidental Mindoro, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) at OMSC Mamburao Campus. I am passionate about technology and eager to develop my skills to become a future software engineer. One of my strengths is decision-making, which helps me approach challenges with confidence and problem-solving mindset.
           Outside academics, I have a talent for playing four different musical instruments, showing my creativity, discipline, and dedication in both arts and technology.
